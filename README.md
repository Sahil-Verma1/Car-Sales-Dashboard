"ðŸš— From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: My Power BI Journey ðŸ“Š



I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project, where I delved into car sales data to uncover valuable insights. 

Hereâ€™s a glimpse into the process:



- Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered and cleaned data to ensure accuracy.



- Data Modeling: Structure the data to build relationships and create calculated columns.



- Visualization Creation: Designed interactive dashboards using a variety of charts and visuals, including:



- Bar charts to track total sales by fuel type and transmission.



- Line Charts to analyze car sales trends over the years.



- Cards to highlight key metrics like the most expensive cars.



- Pie Charts to represent the distribution of sales by seller type.



This project not only provided valuable insights into the automotive market but also sharpened my skills in data modeling, visualization, and storytelling.
